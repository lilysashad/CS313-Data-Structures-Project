# CS313-Data-Structures-Project
Semester-long Java project to implement various data structures

Submitted by: **Lily Deng**

## Warm-Up (or Project 0)

Create a Student class containing Student Name, (String) ID, and an “extended” class StudentRecord which includes an ArrayList of Courses (String)  and write a tester to make sure the class works correctly. (Make sure that equals and compareTo work correctly!) We will review Inheritance and Polymorphism as needed!

## Project 1

Write a program that can maintain a Roster of StudentRecords, using a LinkedList structure to enter students originally, and then storing the students into a sorted array. with a maximum of 10 students in the roster. The program should be able to search for a given student, add a student from the main roster, and drop a student from the main roster; students should also be able to add or drop a Course. If a student drops all courses, the student should be dropped from the main roster. The roster should be saved as a text file.

## Project 2

Use a Queue structure to maintain a waiting list to add new students if a student is deleted. The waiting list will be saved as a separate text file.

## Project 3

You will increase the class size to 20, using the waiting list to fill the class, and implement the initial linked structure as a BST. Once the registration is completed (“end of withdraw period”) the BST will be saved again as a sorted array, and the final roster will be saved as a text file.

## Project 4 & 5 

You will now create an alternate way to access student records, using a Hash Table and the Student ID to store, search and retrieve information.

Document the project, including overall runtimes for each of the parts.  You can create the document as you work on the project, and just submit the finished document separately, or just “Javadoc” to create the documentation as you write the project.

 ## Notes

Overall grade for project is pending
